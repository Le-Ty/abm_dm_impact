MA Thesis - ABM for holistic fairness evaluation

## Usage

### Setup

#### Requirements

For clearer specification of our setup, we make use of
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to keep track of dependencies and python
versions. Details such as python and package versions can be found in the
generated [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) and [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) files.

For poetry users, getting setup is as easy as running

```terminal
poetry install
```
